# HampHack Code of Conduct

_Based on the [MLH Code of Conduct](https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf)_

**TL;DR** - Be respectful! Any types of harassment or abuse are not tolerated. If you're in a situation where you feel uncomfortable, please contact a member of the HampHack team. If a member of the HampHack team is the cause of your discomfort, please contact the lead organizer (see below).

HampHack, along with Hampshire College where it's events are hosted, stands for inclusivity. Everyone has a right to learn in a safe and welcoming environment.

Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, social class, economic status, veteran status. Additional cases of harassment include but not limited to sharing sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, brigading, doxxing, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. If what youâ€™re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment and is enough reason to
stop doing it.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event.

Despite HampHack being an exclusive 18+ event, we still ask you to keep things PG-13. If you have to ask "is this okay in public?", maybe don't do it. HampHack organizers reserve the right to ask participants to be respectful of others and the space they're in.

If you are being harassed, or notice someone being harassed, or have any other concerns, please report it to a HampHack organizer.

HampHack reserves the right to contact campus security or local law enforcement, at the sole discretion of the organizers, in the case of a threat to anyone's safety.

If there is a threat to yourself or anyone else, please call Hampshire College Campus Safety and Wellbeing at 413-559-5424. If you are in immediate danger, please call 911. You may find more information about CSW [here](https://www.hampshire.edu/student-life/campus-safety-and-wellbeing).

Most importantly, treat people how you would want to be treated, or better.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the lead organizer, [Jack Merrill](mailto:jme22@hampshire.edu) (jme22@hampshire.edu)
