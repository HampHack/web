_Based on the [MLH Code of Conduct](https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf)_

**TL;DR** - Be respectful! Any types of harassment or abuse are not tolerated. If you're in a situation where you feel uncomfortable, please contact a member of the HampHack team. If a member of the HampHack team is the cause of your discomfort, please contact the lead organizer (see below).

HampHack, along with Hampshire College where it's events are hosted, stands for inclusivity. Everyone has a right to learn in a safe and welcoming environment. Student groups and student group events at Hampshire College are held to the policies and guidelines outlined in [Hampshire College's Student Handbook](https://handbook.hampshire.edu/node/1). HampHack is no exception. See the Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation Policy section below for more information.

Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, social class, economic status, veteran status. Additional cases of harassment include but not limited to sharing sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, brigading, doxxing, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. If what you’re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment and is enough reason to
stop doing it.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event.

Despite HampHack being an exclusive 18+ event, we still ask you to keep things PG-13. If you have to ask "is this okay in public?", maybe don't do it. HampHack organizers reserve the right to ask participants to be respectful of others and the space they're in.

If you are being harassed, or notice someone being harassed, or have any other concerns, please report it to a HampHack organizer.

HampHack reserves the right to contact campus security or local law enforcement, at the sole discretion of the organizers, in the case of a threat to anyone's safety.

If there is a threat to yourself or anyone else, please call Hampshire College Campus Safety and Wellbeing at [413-559-5424](tel:+14135595424). You may find more information about CSW [here](https://www.hampshire.edu/student-life/campus-safety-and-wellbeing). If you are in a life threatening situation, please call 911.

Most importantly, treat people how you would want to be treated, or better.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the lead organizer, [Jack Merrill](mailto:jme22@hampshire.edu) (jme22@hampshire.edu)

It is a violation of College policy to retaliate in any way against an individual or a group because the individual or group made a good faith report concerning a violation of this policy, was the subject of a report, or otherwise participated in the College’s investigation of such a report. Retaliation includes threatening, intimidating, harassing or any other conduct that would discourage a reasonable person from engaging in activity protected under this policy. Any individual who believes they have been the subject of retaliation should immediately report their concerns to the chief diversity officer. The College will take immediate and appropriate action to any report of retaliation and may pursue disciplinary action as appropriate.

## Harassment, Other Forms of Discrimination, and Retaliation

### Discrimination
Discrimination is adverse treatment of any individual based on the protected class or category to whom they belong, rather than on the basis of their individual merit. The protected categories include race, color, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and gender expression, transgender identity, genetic information, religion, national origin, disability, veteran/military status or any other characteristic under applicable federal or state law.

In employment, discrimination or harassment may begin with adverse actions that may include using different standards of evaluation for employment, promotion or job performance on the basis of protected categories; denying an employee’s request for reasonable accommodations; denying employment opportunity or terminating on the basis of protected categories; retaliation against an employee participating in an investigation of discrimination and harassment.

For students discrimination and harassment may begin with differential treatment in their education program or activity on the basis of their protected category. This may include using different standards to evaluate academic performance on the basis of the protected category; denying academic, social, recreational, health services and housing on the basis of the protected category; retaliation against a student participating in an investigation of discrimination and harassment.

### Harassment
Harassment is unwelcome conduct directed toward a person based on one or more protected categories or statuses of that person, when either of these conditions are met:
  1. Submission to or rejection of such conduct is either an explicit or implicit term or
condition of an individual’s academic standing, evaluation of academic
work or advancement in an academic program, or employment, is used as the basis for College
decisions affecting the individual (often referred to as “quid pro quo” or “this for that”
harassment—this type of harassment is governed by the sexual misconduct, relationship violence, and stalking policy).
  2. The conduct is severe, persistent or pervasive that it interferes with an individual’s academic performance, participation in College programs or activities, employment and creates a working, learning, program or activity environment that a reasonable person would find intimidating, hostile or offensive.

Examples of such conduct include:
  - Offensive or degrading remarks, verbal abuse, or other hostile behavior such as insulting, teasing, mocking, degrading or ridiculing another person or group;
  - Racial slurs, derogatory remarks about a person’s accent, or display of racially offensive symbols;
  - Unwelcome or inappropriate physical contact, comments, questions, advances, jokes, epithets or demands;
  - Physical assault or stalking;
  - Displays or electronic transmission of derogatory, demeaning or hostile materials; and
  - Unwillingness to train, evaluate, assist, or work with an employee.

### Retaliation
It is a violation of College policy to retaliate in any way against an individual or a group because the individual or group made a good faith report concerning a violation of this policy, was the subject of a report, or otherwise participated in the College’s investigation of such a report. Retaliation includes threatening, intimidating, harassing or any other conduct that would discourage a reasonable person from engaging in activity protected under this policy. Any individual who believes they have been the subject of retaliation should immediately report their concerns to the chief diversity officer. The College will take immediate and appropriate action to any report of retaliation and may pursue disciplinary action as appropriate.

Please refer to the grievance policy in this handbook for guidance on how to report allegations of discrimination or harassment. Please note that the grievance policy in this manual does not address sexual assault, sexual exploitation, relationship violence, stalking, or sexual or gender-based harassment. Those categories of prohibited conduct are governed by the College’s Title IX grievance policy or sexual misconduct, relationship violence and stalking policy, which also establishes separate procedures that outline how the College assesses, investigates and resolves reports of such prohibited conduct against student respondents (Appendix A) and employee respondents (Appendix B).
